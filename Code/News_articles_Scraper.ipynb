The NCB is investigating the drug links in Rajput\\'s death. The actor was found dead in his apartment on June 14, 2020 in Mumbai and the case has since been transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation.\\n\\nNews outlets such as the Times of India, Hindustan Times and ABP News cited tweets from an impostor account pretending to be Indrajit Chakraborty.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBelow is a screenshot of the Hindustan Times article.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe impostor account in a series of tweets blamed the judiciary and the media for the treatment meted out to his children post the death of Sushant Singh Rajput.\\n\\nThe fake account is neither verified nor does it contain a disclaimer in its bio that states it is a fan account.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne such tweet by the fake account states how Indrajit Chakraborty has been shattered after the arrest and contemplated ending his life. The text of the tweet reads, \"No father can bear injustice on his daughter. I should die #JusticeForRhea.\" (Here is the archive of the tweet).\\n\\nAnother tweet, where the impostor account is questioning Rhea Chakraborty\\'s trial by media was also cited in the articles.
